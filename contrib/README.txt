This is a Windows .BAT version of the djvudigital shell script.
It was contributed by <tumagonx@users.sourceforge.net> and is 
offered here without guarantees.

It searches for csepdjvu.exe and ghostcript along the command PATH
or in the same directory as the bat file.  The ghostscript program 
is assumed to contain the gsdjvu driver (djvusep). If this is not
the case, the script will fail to work.

If you want to process compressed file, you need to install
the executable gzip.exe in the same directory as the bat file.
If you want to use the option --poppler={text,meta}, you also
need to have the file xml2dsed.awk and the executable gawk.exe
in the same directory as the batch file, and the executables
djvused.exe and pdftodjvu.exe myst be found along the PATH
or again in the same directory as the batch file.
