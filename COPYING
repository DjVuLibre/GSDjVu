| The Common Public License is incompatible with the GPL because it    |
| has various specific requirements that are not in the GPL.           |
| For example, it requires certain patent licenses be given that the   |
| GPL does not require. (We don't think those patent license           |
| requirements are inherently a bad idea, but nonetheless they         |
| are incompatible with the GNU GPL.)                                  |
