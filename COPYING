HISTORY
-------

The DJVULIBRE-GSDJVU source code distribution is derived from the
ATT-GSDJVU code released on the AT&T Labs Research web site under the
terms of the Common Public License Version V1.0 (CPL) in June 2005. 


LICENCE
-------

Since DJVULIBRE-GSDJVU is derived ATT-GSDJVU, it is distributed under
the terms of the Common Public License V1.0 (CPL). The full text of the
CPL is available in file COPYING.CPL.

The differences between DJVULIBRE-GSDJVU and ATT-GSDJVU have been
contributed by Leon Bottou. Recipients of the DJVULIBRE-GSDJVU source
code distribution can use and copy these differences under the terms of
the GNU General Public License, either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version. The full text of the GPL is 
available in file COPYING.CPL.

In consequence, should AT&T decide to authorize the redistribution of
ATT-GSDJVU under the terms of the GPL, the DJVULIBRE-GSDJVU source code
would also be fully available under the terms of the GPL.





LICENCE INCOMPATIBILITY
-------------------------

The CPL a genuine free software license that is unfortunately
incompatible with the GPL.

Both ATT-GSDJVU and DJVULIBRE-GSDJVU contain the source code of a driver
for the GHOSTSCRIPT program <http://www.ghostscript.com>, which is often
distributed under the terms of the GPL .  Although both DJVULIBRE-GSDJVU
and the GHOSTSCRIPT source code are available under free software
licenses, the license incompatibility is a serious problem.

We reproduce below the Free Software Foundation comments on the CPL:

 | This is a free software license but it is incompatible with the GPL. |
 |                                                                      |
 | The Common Public License is incompatible with the GPL because it    |
 | has various specific requirements that are not in the GPL.           |
 | For example, it requires certain patent licenses be given that the   |
 | GPL does not require. (We don't think those patent license           |
 | requirements are inherently a bad idea, but nonetheless they         |
 | are incompatible with the GNU GPL.)                                  |
 |                                                                      |
 +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The requirements of the CPL, including the incompatible requirements
identified by the FSF, are detailed in section 3 of the CPL.  These
requirements only apply to the redistribution of CPL licensed programs.

Therefore we believe that anyone is free to download both the
DJVULIBRE-GSDJVU and GHOSTSCRIPT source code packages and to use them as
they see fit. In particular, anyone can combine and compile these source
code packages. However, it is not possible to redistribute the GSDJVU
executable, because it is not possible to satisfy the redistribution
requirements of both the CPL and the GPL.

The above statement is merely the expression of our belief.  It should
not be understood as a guarantee of any kind. Copyleft license
compatibility is a complicated issue. You must form your own opinion
before using DJVULIBRE-GSDJVU.




HOW TO FIX THIS UNFORTUNATE SITUATION ?
---------------------------------------

First of all, you should not ignore the current licenses.  
In particular, we strongly advise you against redistributing
combinations of DJVULIBRE-GSDJVU and GHOSTSCRIPT to anyone.

The only practical way to solve the incompatibility issue is 
to politely ask our AT&T friends to clarify their intentions.

Please send a brief email to AT&T's Intellectual Property 
Licensing organization <licensing@att.com> with a copy
to <djvu-gsdjvu@lists.sourceforge.net>.

- First thank them warmly because they worked very hard and 
  used their hard earned professional credit to help 
  release GSDJVU under a free license.

- Second give your best argument to justify authorizing the
  redistribution of GSDJVU under the GPL. 
  Here are a few examples:

    * Whatever the purposes of the ATT-GSDJVU open source release are, 
      this purpose would be better served by licensing terms that
      facilitate the use of GSDJVU.

    * Legally, what does it mean to release a source code (ATT-GSDJVU),
      whose operation technically depends on a second program (GHOSTSCRIPT), 
      under terms that are incompatible with those of this second program.

Alas, nothing suggests that this problem will be fixed immediately.  
Our AT&T contacts indicate that they currently have other priorities 
or policies. Yet, priorities and policies change with time.



OTHER USES OF GSDJVU BESIDES DJVU
---------------------------------

In return we would like to drop a few ideas on commercialy feasible uses
of the GSDJVU technology besides DJVU compression. Do not hesitate to
contact AT&T's <licensing@att.com> to commercially 
license GSDJVU for such purposes.

GSDJVU is a very powerful technology that analyzes each page of an
electronically generated document and decomposes it as (1) a low
resolution continuous color background image, and (2) a collection of
high resolution foreground objects having each a single flat color.

Such a decomposition can be very useful:

* PDF Optimization --- The quality and size of PDF files vary
  dramatically according to the quality of the input material. 
  The GSDJVU decomposition is a good basis to significantly
  reduce the size of badly authored PDF files.

* Printing --- Most printers represent colors with dithering. 
  Large dithering patterns give accurate colors at the 
  expense of resolution.  Small dithering patterns give 
  coarser colors with higher resolution.  The GSDJVU decomposion 
  neatly identifies which parts of a page are best printed 
  using small or large dithering patterns.

* Helping vision challenged persons --- The GSDJVU decomposition 
  allows for dimming graphical embellishments that make reading 
  difficult and enhancing the contrast of the meaningful 
  text and graphics.
